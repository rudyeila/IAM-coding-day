# IAM-coding-day
The IAM coding day was a coding marathon organized by the iC Consult Group in cooperation with the research group Cooperation & Management at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Allianz SE.

Each team of 3-5 people was tasked with developing an application that made personalized insurance offers to users upon logging into the application. Required was a single page application that integrates a login based on a partially configured Forgerock IAM instance. A database containing some test data was also provided. 

During the challenge, my work was mainly in developing the backend to the application and implementing the necessary APIs for integrating the IAM system and making the personalized offers based on the information available on the user in the database.
